1. Variables and Data Types:
   - JavaScript uses variables to store data. You can declare variables using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.
   - JavaScript has several built-in data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more.

2. [[Operators]]
   - JavaScript supports various operators, such as arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `>`, `<`), logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`), and more.

3. Control Flow:
   - Conditional statements like `if`, `else if`, and `else` allow you to perform different actions based on certain conditions.
   - Loops such as `for`, `while`, and `do...while` enable you to repeat a block of code until a specified condition is met.

4. Functions:[[advanced functions js]]
   - JavaScript functions allow you to encapsulate reusable blocks of code. You can define functions using the `function` keyword or using arrow function syntax (`() => {}`).
   - Functions can have parameters and can return values.

5. Objects and Object-Oriented Programming:
   - JavaScript is an object-oriented language, allowing you to create objects with properties and methods.
   - You can define objects using object literals or constructor functions, and you can access object properties using dot notation (`object.property`) or bracket notation (`object['property']`).

6. [[Arrays]]:
   - JavaScript arrays store multiple values in a single variable.
   - You can access and manipulate array elements using index values, and there are several built-in array methods, such as `push()`, `pop()`, `slice()`, `map()`, and more.

7. DOM Manipulation:
   - The Document Object Model (DOM) is an API that represents the HTML structure of a webpage.
   - JavaScript can interact with the DOM, allowing you to manipulate HTML elements, modify content, add event listeners, and more.

8. Asynchronous Programming:
   - JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await.
   - Asynchronous operations allow non-blocking execution, enabling tasks like making API requests or handling user interactions without freezing the browser.

9. Error Handling:
   - JavaScript provides error handling mechanisms using `try...catch` blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
   - You can use `throw` to manually throw an error.

10. Modules and Libraries:
    - JavaScript supports modular programming using modules. ES6 introduced the `import` and `export` statements to facilitate module usage.
    - There are various libraries and frameworks built on JavaScript, such as React, Angular, Vue.js, Express.js, and many more, which provide additional functionality and tools for specific use cases.




These fundamentals cover the core concepts of JavaScript, but there is much more to explore and learn as you dive deeper into the language. Practice writing code, experiment with examples, and refer to official documentation and resources to enhance your understanding and proficiency in JavaScript.
